figure out animation

draw rotated boxes
draw rotated boxes via 4 points

better coordinate system (non window specific)
abstract away the sdl stuff
class system:
renderer (incl viewport)
figure
-dot (circle) - midpoint algorithm
-line (rotated box with circled out endpoints)
-polygons - filled and unfilled
-thickness for all these
-text
-graph embedding (possibly with edge labels)

also store all these with underlying basic CG structures
- allow for basic CG algorithms

interactive drawing of these

saving/loading data


create an interface for stuff:
init()
update(time delta?) - returns a diagram (that will then be drawn)
